# About

Slatepacks are intented to simplify the exchange process for Slates in a secure and userfriendly way. Current file based methods have the following cons:
* Files content is well readable, because of that it is not secure.
* Files are susceptible to man in the middle attack because files are not addressed to specific wallet.
* Users don't like files for exchanges. Sting with content is more friendly.

To address those issues MWC adopts grin's Slatepacks:  https://docs.grin.mw/wiki/transactions/slatepack/ <br>
Altho MWC slatepacks look very similar, the implementation is very different.

This document desribes the Slatepack format and our deviation from grins Implementation.

# Community-level explanation
Slatepacks Simplify the existing transaction building process in MWC in a few ways:

Behind the scenes there are two synchronous methods and one asynchronous method supported by default.
Tor and MQS are the synchronous transaction transport methods that are tried first. If not successful, the transaction process automatically falls back to using a copy and pastable SlatepackMessage string to complete the transaction asynchronously by exchanging the Slatepack message manually.

So in easier words this simplyfies transactions alot as it's usable by a simple copy paste without the requirement to be online. Meanwhile it keeps the benefits of TOR transactions in case both parties are online. 

An Example to elaborate;

```mwc-wallet send -d SlatepackAddress 1.337``` will first try to send MWC synchronously via Tor/MQS to the SlatepackAddress
If that fails it will fall back to outputting an armored encrypted SlatepackMessage string that only you and the recipient can decipher if a TOR address was used. 
In the case of MQS it will generate a non encrypted SlatepackMessage.
This SlatepackMessage can then be exchanged manually by copy and paste.
Example SlatepackAddress: f4ujdq2hzidsrwljst4mfxoaogolqzhwzbu4uxjke6w4ibclqgxaowid

If a counterparty is unwilling or unable to provide a SlatepackAddress, an unencrypted plain text SlatepackMessage can still be exchanged

Sending a mobile MWC transaction should be as easy as scanning a simple QR code encoded from a bech32 SlatepackAddress
Or as easy as pasting the SlatepackAddress of your counterparty into your wallet for any other device.
Or if Tor is not accessible, or the receiving party is not online, as easy as copying and pasting a couple of SlatepackMessage strings with a counterparty in an alternative communication channel (email, forum, social media, instant messenger, generic web text box, carrier pigeon etc.)


# Reference-level explanation
## Slatepack Address

MWC has a 'ProvableAddress' that includes a TOR or MQS address. For Slatepacks we will continue to use them. For encrypted Slatepacks only TOR 
addresses can be used because of encryption/decryption internals.  If the ProvableAddress is a MQS Address it can't be used for encrypted slatepacks, but will generate an unencrypted SlatepackMessage instead.

Please note, ProvableAddress is applicable to encrypted slatepack only.

## Message Armor

Grin Armor does binary to Base58 conversion and it works great for us. This part works as it is, the only change is the header and footer.
https://docs.grin.mw/wiki/transactions/slatepack/#armor

For normal encrypted slatepacks the header/footer are: BEGINSLATEPACK / ENDSLATEPACK

For non encrypted slatepacks in binary format the header/footer are: BEGINSLATE_BIN / ENDSLATE_BIN

## Encryption/Decryption

Grin's original design is using the 'age' rust library for encryption/decryption. The Age library had a huge data overhead on data size.
The header is about 350 bytes. For example, initial send message size less then 150 bytes. Such overhead is not acceptable.
Also it is not clear if age will allow to read the message that was archived. 

In MWC's implementation we don't use age, encryption/decryption is done with the same primitives as described below;

### Encryption (sender side)

* Sender supply it's own ed25519 secret and receiver ed25519 public key.
* sender's ed25519 SecretKey and recipient's ed25519 PublicKey are converted to x25519 StaticKey and x25519 PublicKey
* calculating Diffie Hellman Shared Secret value.
* Encrypt the data with this Shared Secret using symmetrical AEAD CHACHA20_POLY1305 algorithm. 
* Resulting data is 16 bytes larger then original one.

## Decryption (recipient side)

* Read sender ed25519 PublicKey from unencrypted part of the payload. The recipient supply it's own ed25519 SecretKey.
* recipient's ed25519 SecretKey and sender's ed25519 PublicKey are converted to x25519 StaticKey and x25519 PublicKey
* calculating Diffie Hellman Shared Secret value.
* Decrypt the data with this Shared Secret using symmetrical AEAD CHACHA20_POLY1305 algorithm. 
* Resulting data is 16 bytes smaller then original one.

## Slatepack Binary Data Format

Users working with armored message, but underneath it is a pure binary format. Here we describe the format, so it will be easier to understand it. 

MWC slate data is using bit streaming as a format for data serialization. The serialization/deserialization functions are symmetrical and
aren't using serde because we want full control to maintain compatibility. Backward compatibility will be maintained. The forward compatibility is nice to have, but it is not guaranteed.
